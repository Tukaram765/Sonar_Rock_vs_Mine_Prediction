Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction
This project uses Machine Learning (Logistic Regression) to classify whether a sonar signal is reflected from a Rock or a Mine.

📂 Project Overview
Sonar signals are used to detect underwater objects. The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict if a sonar signal is coming from a rock or a mine, based on the given features.

We use the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which consists of 60 numerical features representing energy levels at various frequencies.

📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Sonar Dataset

Features: 60 numerical features.

Target:

M : Mine

R : Rock

🚀 Project Workflow
Load the dataset using Pandas.

Preprocess the data.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate the model using Accuracy Score.

📈 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using the accuracy score on both the training and test datasets.
